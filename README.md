This project examines gun-related death rates across U.S. regions in 2021, highlighting significant regional disparities. 

* Southern states, including Mississippi (33.9) and Louisiana, have the highest mortality rates, while Northeastern states like Massachusetts (3.4) and Connecticut report the lowest.

* The study also reflects demographic factors like sex, as gun violence disproportionately affects males. 

* The national average gun death rate is 16.36 per 100,000 people

  
These insights call for region-specific policies and targeted interventions to address the complex nature of gun-related fatalities. 

By identifying states with rates above and below the national average, the study underscores the urgent need for targeted policy interventions and public safety measures to reduce gun violence nationwide.
